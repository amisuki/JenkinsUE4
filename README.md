# Jenkins UE4
Documentation and jenkins pipeline for Epic's Unreal Engine 4

## Important Note
This is project in progress, no guaranty given.
Do not use on projet without backup / source control !


## Introduction

This project is about setting up a Jenkins server and pipelines for UE4 project(s) on a windows machine.
Only tested on Windows 10 with administrator rights.
Using perforce 2018.2 as source control.

A big part of this setup is only required for teams that will make modifications to UE4 source code.

Part of this setup is done by downloading the engine directly from Epic's github, but note that it could be modified to be automatic and/or work with Epic's perforce version.
