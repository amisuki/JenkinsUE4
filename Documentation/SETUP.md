# Setup

Steps to have the engine, perforce and jenkins setup in order to run the jenkins pipelines of this project.

## Preparation

You will need a lot of disk space during that setup, at least 10GB. (This do not
take in account space on the perforce server)									// TODO TODO : update disk space taken by jenkins setup

Setup a github account in order to be able to download a version of UE4:
https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine

Select the version of the engine you want to use and download the zip

Unzip to your harddrive.

Run Setup.bat (This will download around 5GB of additional data)
